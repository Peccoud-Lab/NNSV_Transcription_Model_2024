This repository contains the code used for the article "The Transcriptional Gradient in NNSVs is Explained by the Processivity of Their Polymerases"

Notebook1 contains the python code for fitting the RAM model and performing MCMC. The outputs of this notebook are the parameter fits and MCMC statistics in Folder1 and Folder2. The data in these folders was make Table S1. The images used to generate all panels in figure 2.

Notebook2 contains the python code for fitting the RAM and Start-Stop models so that their predictive capabilities could be compared.  The images used to create figure 4 are generated by this notebook.

Markdown1 contains the R Markdown code for fitting the linear regression model connecting polymerase processivity to genome length. It also generates the image used in figure 3.
