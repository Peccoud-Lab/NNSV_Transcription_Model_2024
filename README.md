This repository contains the code used for the article "The Transcriptional Gradient in NNSVs is Explained by the Processivity of Their Polymerases"

Notebook1 contains the python code for fitting the single parameter RAM model. The outputs of this notebook are the parameter fits and parameter fit statistics in Folder1 and Folder2. The data in these folders was make Table S1. The images used to generate all panels in figure 2 as well as the statistics in Table S2.

Notebook2 contains the python code for fitting the models to the two-parameter extended RAM model that incorporates gene overlaps/ The outputs of this notebook are the parameter fits and parameter fit statistics in Folder3 and Folder4. The data in Folder4 was used to make Table S3. The images used to create figure 3  are also generated by this notebook.



Markdown1 contains the R Markdown code for fitting the linear regression model connecting polymerase processivity to genome length. It also generates the image used in figure 4.
